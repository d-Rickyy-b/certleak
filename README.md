Monitor ssl certificates in real time!  
Certleak is a tool to analyze TLS certificates as they are issued.
It is heavily inspired by [Phishing Catcher](https://github.com/x0rz/phishing_catcher) by [x0rz](https://twitter.com/x0rz). 

It utilizes the [Certificate Transparency Network](https://www.certificate-transparency.org/what-is-ct) which is a framework for publicly monitoring issuance of TLS certificates.

Instead of querying the single transparency logs individually, certpwn uses certstream for analyzing certificates in real time.
Certpwn uses about 2600-3000 kbit/s of bandwidth


CertPwn can be used to monitor 

âš  Please keep in mind that certpwn only enables you to analyze live data.
There is no way to use this tool to analyze certificates that have been issued in the past or while being offline.
